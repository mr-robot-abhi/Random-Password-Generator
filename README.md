You can create your personal random password generator tool using `Python`. In this project we will use a GUI(Graphical User Interface) tool named `tkinter` to create a window to get a cool software like feel into it.
```
What the program does? 

- You need to select some parameters: ascii_letters | Punctuation | digits | alpha | symbol | number 
- A random password will be generated using random() function
- A new window and button will be created
- As you click the button, a password will be generated and displayed on the screen
```
In the source code function, there is a for loop: for i in range(x):
For the current program, the x is 6. Hence the random password generated would be 6*3 characters which is 18 characters. 
The x can be changed to generate random passwords as required. 

### Requirements

* Python
* Python Libraries: `random` `tkinter` `string`
